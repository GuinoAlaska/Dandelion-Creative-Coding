Project Description:
Dandelion Creative Coding is an independently developed browser-based creative coding platform, built entirely solo. It allows users to create, import, and preview p5.js, .txt, and .json files within a custom environment tailored for experimentation, learning, and interactive projects.

Protected Elements:
- The names and slogan: `Dandelion Creative Coding`, `Dandelion CC`, `"If you can dream it, you can create it."`, on all translations.
- The exact content of the following files: `editor/index.html`, `editor/styles.css`, `editor/sketch.js`, `editor/codeReader.js`, `editor/UX.js`, `MobileMenu.js`, `theme.js`, `searchBar.js`, `configuration/config.js`, `sprites/icons.png`, `sprites/tab-icons.png`, and any other files located in the same project directory as this file.
- Any reproduction or derivative work that includes more than 10% of this project's original code or visual assets.
- The implementation and system logic behind the secondary sketch panel used for p5.js development (e.g., `bottomSketch`, `bottomP5Instance`) and the new platform-wide project system. Variable names are not protected; however, the underlying interaction logic and rendering flow are.

All rights reserved.

Notes:
- This platform is developed specifically for running and previewing p5.js code.  
  p5.js is an open-source JavaScript library maintained by the Processing Foundation: https://p5js.org
- The hot reload mechanism is custom-built and not derived from any external template.
- Features like auto-save, console input, Gizmos functions (`beginGizmos()` / `endGizmos()`), and project management are custom-built.
- Portions of the codebase were written with the assistance of GitHub Copilot and/or ChatGPT.
- Content related to Garabatospr (found in Default/DefaultProjects.json, Default/DefaultUsers.json, and Default/.thumbnails) is not part of the platform's copyrighted material. Its inclusion is explicitly authorized for use via e-mail permission.

Security Disclaimer:
- The platform previously included a safety scanner, which is currently inactive. Sketches now run inside a sandboxed iframe. While this improves safety, evaluating untrusted code may still pose security risks. Users are responsible for their own code.
- The environment is intentionally open to allow users to experiment freely. Use at your own risk.
